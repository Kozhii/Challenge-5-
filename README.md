Being a data analyst at Pymaceuticals, we have access to data from an animal study on squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) treatment. The study involved 249 mice receiving various drug regimens, including Capomulin. We created tables and figures for the study report and provide a summary comparing Capomulin's performance to other treatments. The goal is to assess Capomulin's effectiveness against other drugs in treating SCC, a common skin cancer type.

We have found that there is a positive correlation between the weight of a mouse and the size of the tumor volume. As the weight of the mouse increases, the tumor volume tends to increase as well. The majority of mice in the study were treated with either Capomulin or Ramicane. Among the drugs analyzed, Infubinol was the only one that had an outlier in the final tumor volume data. Capomulin had a smaller variance in final tumor volume compared to the other three drugs analyzed (Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin). A smaller variance suggests that the final tumor volumes for mice treated with Capomulin were more tightly clustered around the mean. On the other hand, Ceftamin had a larger variance in final tumor volume compared to the other three drugs analyzed (Capomulin, Ramicane, and Infubinol). A larger variance indicates that the final tumor volumes for mice treated with Ceftamin were more spread out from the mean. These findings highlight the relationships between the mouse weight and tumor volume, the prevalence of certain drug treatments, the presence of an outlier in the Infubinol treatment, and the differences in variance among the analyzed drugs.
